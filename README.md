- It is a state machine with a few states that are described below


## Requirements

iOS 14.0+ / macOS 12.0+

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding BiometricsVault as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift` or the Package list in Xcode.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/ariskox/BiometricsVault.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0"))
]
```

Normally you'll want to depend on the `BiometricsVault` target:

```swift
.product(name: "BiometricsVault", package: "BiometricsVault")
```

## How to use


## States

- Unavailable
    - The device or the application doesn't support authentication with biometrics.
- Ready
    - The Vault is ready to store the credentials to keychain with biometrics lock or unprotected
- ﾎ段ometricsSecured
    - The credentials have been stored to the keychain and are protected by biometrics. They ARE available to us, as the user has been authenticated with biometrics. 沐
- Locked
